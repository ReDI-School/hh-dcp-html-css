# HTML Structure

## Class Agenda

1. HTML Structure
2. Anatomy of an HTML element
3. HTML Page Structure

## 1. HTML Structure

"At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document". [[1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)]

HTML is composed of elements. e.g a paragraph element looks like:

```
<p>Hello world!</p>
```

## 2. Anatomy of an HTML element

- What is an HTML tag?
- What is the opening tag?
- What is the content?
- What is the closing tag?
- Do all elements contain a closing tag?
- What is an Attribute?
- What is a Semantic Tag?
- What is an inline element and what is a block element? What is the [difference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started#block_versus_inline_elements) between them?

## 3. HTML Page Structure

- What is DOCTYPE tag?
- What is the `<html>` tag?
- What goes in the `<head>` tag?
- What is the `<body>`?
- What goes in the `<body>` tag?
- What is the `<title>` tag
- What is the common meta tag usage `<meta name="description">`, `<meta charset="">`.

## 4. Browser DevTools

If time allows it, we would look into browser code inspection via the dev tools. This is a useful way of debugging our html and css code. Therefore, we would need to know how to open the dev tools and work with the basic `Elements` tab of tools.

# Exercise Description

- Open a webpage and look in the dev tools, and identify tags discussed above.
- Make sure you have set up your environment as we are about to start working more often with code.
- Try reaching [checkpoint 3](https://github.com/ReDI-School/nrw-html-and-css/blob/checkpoint2/checkpoint/index.html), which contains the new things taught in class. Add the following tags also:
  - Add a Doctype tag to the page
  - Add a meta tag

# Glossary & Terminology

- `Block HTML Element` - A Block Element always starts on a new line and take up the entire width.
- `Browser Viewport` - The browser viewport is the size of the rectangle that a web page fills on your screen
- `Charset Encoding` - Character encoding is used to represent a repertoire of characters by some encoding system that assigns a number to each character for digital representation, you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding)
- `Empty HTML Element` - An Empty HTML Element has no child or text content
- `HTML Attribute` - An HTML attribute is used to change the behavior of an HTML element or to provide metadata for that element
- `HTML Element` - An HTML element is the fundamental functional unit in an HTML document
- `HTML Tag` - An HTML tag is a word/text surrounded by angle brackets, they are used to create HTML elements
- `Inline HTML Element` - An Inline Element does not start on a new line and take up as much width as necessary
- `Semantic HTML Element` - A Semantic HTML Element describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. In other words, the html tag of a semantic element is very easy to understand by developers. For example, `<table>` is a semantic element that would create a table on the page.

# Homework

- Read about at least ten [semantic HTML elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantic_elements) and when to use them
- Read about the different [HTML metadata elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML#metadata_the_%3Cmeta%3E_element)
- Finish [checkpoint 3](https://github.com/ReDI-School/nrw-html-and-css/blob/checkpoint2/checkpoint/index.html) if you haven't already done so
